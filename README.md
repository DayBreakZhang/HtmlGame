# [totominc.io - homepage](https://totominc.io/)

This is an old repository that I manage only when I have some time. You will find all my old projects, that I made when I was learning programming, especially web tehcnologies. Don't take any sample code of this repo as a good example, they are of very poor quality.

### [Blackmarket - incremental-game](https://archive.totominc.io/blackmarket)
一款简单的点击游戏，关于销售毒品。你只从枪开始，你必须建立一个毒品帝国来成为亿万富翁。黑市是我在HTML/CSS/JS中第一个真正的大项目。它已经被完全重新编写：脚本和接口。黑市已经正式发布了，看看吧！

### [Incremental-RPG](https://archive.totominc.io/incremental-rpg/)
My very second project in JS, where I wanted to focus more on design using Bootstrap and some free themes.

### [Idle-Quester](https://archive.totominc.io/idle-quester/)
Idle-Quester is a web version of the original app/game [Idle-Quest](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.topcog.idlequest.android) for Android.

### [Money-Life (old)](https://archive.totominc.io/moneylife/old/)
My very first small project to learn JS, it's just an [Adventure Capitalist](http://www.kongregate.com/games/hyperhippogames/adventure-capitalist) clone.

### [Money-Life (beta-prototype)](https://archive.totominc.io/moneylife/beta/)
Another attempt at adding more gameplay mechanics for Money-Life.

### [Universe-God (old)](https://archive.totominc.io/universe-god-old/)
Another prototype were you rebuild the universe with your god's hands. It got some decent showcase on /r/incremental_games, maybe I will pick it up one day...

### [Fallout terminal](https://archive.totominc.io/fallout-terminal/)
A very cool Fallout-like terminal effect made mainly with CSS.
